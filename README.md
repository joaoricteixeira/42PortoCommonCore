## 📚 About 42 Common Core

The 42 Common Core is an intensive, project-based curriculum designed to teach:
- Problem solving and algorithmic thinking
- Low-level programming in C
- Unix/Linux systems and shell scripting
- Version control with Git
- Teamwork and peer learning

All projects are built **from scratch**, without relying on external libraries (unless explicitly allowed), and are peer-reviewed by fellow students.

- **`src/`** – source code
- **`includes/`** – header files (if applicable)
